# New Directions
Phase 2 Test for PHP API

# Task
You have been tasked with building a system to allow staff at New Directions (ND) to be able to view potential applicants based on: - 
 - County 
 - Whether they require a DBS check 
 - Position applied for 

You are to build a REST API using PHP that is to be consumed by a website used by the company, which allows staff to query and view the applicant's data & download their relevant CVs.  

You have also heard that ND might be looking to make the API available to third parties to use as well. 

How can we ensure that companies can only see their own applicants? Also, thinking about security, how can we ensure that the API can only be accessed by authorised companies? 

This challenge should cover core disciplines. 

Back-end focus: Using the sample dataset, build an API that can be used by front-end applications 
Front-end focus: Use the API to build a front-end application to present this dataset in a searchable manner to end users
